## Objective

2. Created `online_sales` database and `orders` table
3. Imported cleaned CSV into MySQL
4. Wrote SQL query to:
   - Extract year and month
   - Group data
   - Aggregate revenue (SUM) and order volume (COUNT)
   - Filter for 2024
   - Sort by month

## Output  
Generated a result table showing total revenue and order volume per month for 2024.

## Outcome  
✔ Practical use of SQL aggregations  
✔ Monthly trend analysis completed
